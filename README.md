# POINT-VR
Physics Outreach at Illinois through New Technologies: Developing virtual reality simulations to teach physics.

## Chapter 1
### Goals
What we aim to convey:
* Spacetime is a smooth fabric. 
* The curvature of this spacetime is what we recognize as a gravitational field. “Matter tells space how to curve and space tells matter how to move”
* We can get ripples in the fabric of spacetime: gravitational waves.

Each chapter is approximately 10 minutes worth of content. We will introduce information in smaller, easy to understand pieces via different scenes.
#### Scene 1
Learning Objective: A 4-dimensional smooth and continuous fabric, called spacetime, makes up our universe. <br />
Implementations: Axes objects appearing at the player origin, clock object illustrating time passage
#### Scene 2
Learning Objective: Understand gravity as the curvature of this fabric. “Matter tells spacetime how to curve…” <br />
Implementations: Objects with mass interacting with the 3D grid (deforming it). Ranking objects of different masses.
#### Scene 3
Learning Objective: “...spacetime tells matter how to move.” <br />
Implementations: Get an earth like object to orbit a sun like object over a 3D grid
