1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You should see a 3D grid that represents our three-dimensional space.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, look around you until you find the clock.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This clock allows us to visualize our fourth dimension, time.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Together, the shape of the grid and the ticking of the clock represent spacetime.
