00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
We have spent some time thinking about how an object's mass curves spacetime.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,800
Now let's consider another question:

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,320
how does an object's size affect the curvature of spacetime?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
To answer this question, let's play another quick game.
