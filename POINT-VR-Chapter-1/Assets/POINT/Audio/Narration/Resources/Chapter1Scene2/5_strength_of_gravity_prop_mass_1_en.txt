00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Now that you have had the chance to explore a little, let's make a prediction.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,440
You should see two spheres where both are labeled with their mass.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,120
Which of these two spheres will curve the grid more?

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,760
Test your prediction by moving each sphere onto the grid, one at a time.
