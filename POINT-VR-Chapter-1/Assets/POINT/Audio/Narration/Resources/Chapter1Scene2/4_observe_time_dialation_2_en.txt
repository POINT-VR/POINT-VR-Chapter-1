1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
You should see two clocks at different distances,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,520
and a target location near one of the clocks.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,280
Bring the sphere to the target location

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,500
to observe how gravity affects time.
