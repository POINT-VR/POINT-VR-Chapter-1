1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Now, let's make another prediction.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,240
We previously learned that time slows down in the presence of gravity.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,560
Which of the two spheres will slow one clock more relative to the other clock?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,960
To test your prediction, bring each mass to the target location close to the clock, one

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,240
at a time, and observe what happens.
