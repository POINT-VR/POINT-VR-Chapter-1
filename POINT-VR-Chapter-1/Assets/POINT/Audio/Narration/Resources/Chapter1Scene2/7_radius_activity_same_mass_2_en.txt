The spheres in front of you have the same mass, but are different sizes, meaning that

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,700
they have different volumes and take up different amounts of space.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,300
Do you think a sphere with a smaller volume or larger volume will curve the grid more?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,060
To answer this question, pick up each sphere and place it on the grid one at a time.
