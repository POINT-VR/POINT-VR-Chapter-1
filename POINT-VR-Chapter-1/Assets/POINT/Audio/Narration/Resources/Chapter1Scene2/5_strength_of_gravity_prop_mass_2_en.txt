00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
The sphere with the larger mass curves the grid more than the sphere with the smaller mass.

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,000
This tells us that for objects of the same size,

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the force of gravity is stronger for the object that has more mass.
