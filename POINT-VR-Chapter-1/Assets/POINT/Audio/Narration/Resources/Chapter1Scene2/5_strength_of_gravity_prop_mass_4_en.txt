00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
For two spheres of the same size, the sphere with the larger mass slows time relative to

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,640
the clock that is far away more than the sphere with the smaller mass does.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,400
This tells us that the stronger the force of gravity, the more time will slow down.
