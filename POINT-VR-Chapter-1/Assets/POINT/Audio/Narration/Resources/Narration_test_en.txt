00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
In front of you, you should see a 3D grid that represents our three-dimensional space.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Now look around you until you find a clock.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
This clock allows us to visualize our fourth dimension, time.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Together, the shape of the grid and the ticking of the clock represents space-time.
