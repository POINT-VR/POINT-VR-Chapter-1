00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,766
As we heard earlier, 'Spacetime tells matter how to move;

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:06,650
matter tells spacetime how to curve.'

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,783
In this experience, we investigated how matter tells spacetime to curve 

4
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,136
and saw how an object's mass and radius influence the curvature of spacetime.
